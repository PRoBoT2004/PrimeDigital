    overview: "Luxe Properties needed a sophisticated digital platform that would match the premium nature of their luxury real estate portfolio. The challenge was to create an immersive, elegant experience that would appeal to high-net-worth individuals while providing powerful search and visualization tools.",
    challenge: "The existing website was outdated and didn't reflect the luxury brand. Users struggled with poor search functionality, low-quality images, and lack of interactive features. The platform needed to showcase million-dollar properties in a way that would captivate potential buyers.",
    solution: "We designed and developed a cutting-edge real estate platform with 3D property tours, advanced filtering systems, interactive maps, and a sophisticated UI that reflects luxury and elegance. The platform includes virtual staging, drone photography integration, and AI-powered property recommendations.",
